### Django site for malteheckelen.com

I made this site two years ago as a Django exercise. Might delete it and put something more manageable in its place someday (although I was quite content with the design at the start). In the mean-time, here it is.

The site features a blog as well as a subsite which allows Twitter users to donate Twitter tokens. With these, you can query more data from the Twitter API, which was desirable to me because it meant I could do more Social Media Analysis (academic context). If you want to replicate this functionality, you also need an approved Twitter app and need to mind the Twitter API Guidelines.

Someday I will put some more meaningful documentation here, so that anyone interested can use it as a template.
