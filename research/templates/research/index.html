	<p>The dissertation project is focused on the one hand on polarization as a mass phenomenon and on the other on cognitive assumptions from persuasion research. People use mental heuristics to, for instance, break down the complexity of a topic and, possible due to time pressure (or low interest), to be able to make a judgement or decision quickly. Such phenomena are related to individual polarization and social influence through various pathways. The project is focused on describing the relation of individual polarization to polarization as a mass phenomenon through empirical analysis as well as simulation.</p>

	<p>In social psychology and political science, effects of mental heuristics on persuasion and polarization are primarily researched through individual or small group experiments. Certain effect patterns are visible, but the strength and direction of these effects varies considerably. This could be due to small samples and the various, highly interactive predictors. However, communication is subject to norms like any other social phenomenon. These peer group norms possibly also exert influence on the way an individual is (subconsciously) predispositioned to the usage of mental heuristics and related tools in certain scenarios. It might also factor in decisions on which communications are considered more valid and persuasive (e.g. some communities may find communications from the same group more persuasive than scientific evidence).</p>

	<p>To research this, a sociologically oriented decision model is constructed, in which individuals base their communicative decisions on their knowledge of peer group communicative behavior. This model serves as a theoretical underpinning for the empirical analysis of Twitter data. This data is gathered on various connected communities and their discussions of various topics over time. To relate the more individual-focused decision model to large-scale implications, an agent-based model will be constructed.</p>
