	<b>Outline</b>: The dissertation project is focused the links between polarization as an individual and as a mass phenomenon. Of particular interest is the social influence of social influence. Research shows that people do use mental heuristics to break down a topic under certain circumstances, e.g. if the topic impacts their life considerably or the media appear very polarized on the topic. They might orient their judgements for topics on emotional signals, status of communicators, or other, instead of or additionally to carefully evaluating arguments. Such phenomena are related to (mostly temporary) individual polarization and social influence through various pathways. However, research does mostly not take into account the social nature of communication behaviour: The circumstances sufficient for a person to primarily rely on heuristics might change, <i>depending in which social environment the person is in</i>. This is something that would change continuously and unforeseeably on a larger scale, where the person has to consider with which group she engages (and to which group she belongs to in that situation).<br>
	<br>
	The project is focused on examining the possibility of this phenomenon. Decision and Game Theory is used to build individual-level theory. The complex aggregation dynamics of such an individual decision model in scenarios of mass communication are then theoretically explored in an agent-based model for certain scenarios. Empirical analysis of Twitter conversations serves as observational evidence of surface phenomena and also delivers scenarios of interest for simulation.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Phenomenon and Hypothesis</b>: In social psychology and political science, effects of mental heuristics on persuasion and polarization are primarily researched through individual or small group experiments. Certain effect patterns are visible, but the strength and direction of these effects varies considerably. This could be due to constraints leading to small and/or biased samples and the various, highly interactive predictive factors. However, communication is also subject to norms like any other social phenomenon. Peer group norms might exert influence on the way an individual is (subconsciously) predispositioned to the usage of mental heuristics and related tools in certain scenarios. In this way, peer group norms might also factor in decisions on which communications are considered more valid and persuasive.<br>
	<br>
	Some examples: Some communities may find anecdotal evidence presented by community members to be more persuasive than scientific evidence from outsiders. Academic communities on the other hand might sanction such evaluative behavior, while also discounting valid evidence or critique coming from other fields due to ingroup behavior. These biases might be complex and are not a simple case of group-membership. Someone might have his own preferences for communication that sometimes clash with their multiple group-memberships. A scientist or scholar engaging with discussion in a comics forum will try different forms of arguments than a die-hard fan that works in retail, however, both will try to be persuasive and so adjust their contributions to a degree that is tolerable to them. Such a situation can be considered strategic. Discussion participants need to put themselves into the shoes of others at least minimally to make a persuasive argument.<br>
	<br>
	In highly networked environments such as social media, communicators (often) live inside their own bubbles, while also being exposed to communications that were constructed under vastly different circumstances. What gets signalled as a useful social meta-criterions of persuasiveness in these communications was (subconsciously) intended for a certain audience. Even though there may be a common ground substantively, a misunderstanding about communicative conduct prevents the effective communication of such common ground. Through network structure or social media features, this recontextualization happens in such a way that communicators cannot anticipate it. While normative cohesion about validness and persuasiveness in communicative behavior is a reliable reduction of complexity when needed for smaller, more close-knit communities, noise about what this normative cohesion <i>is</i> increases when messages get routinely recontextualized. To still be able to use this mechanism, a person would have to escape to more extreme and thus more easily and globally identifiable parts of the behavioral spectrum, making compromise harder and harder. Apart from and in interaction with obvious ideological differences, this might be a further explanation for a "hardening" of the ideological fronts even for those who are regularly exposed to and interested in diverse viewpoints.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Decision Model</b>: Based on these notions, I am constructing a decision model, in which communicators have imperfect information about the state of the discussion as well as the norms surrounding them. Communicators have types corresponding to personal preferences on the amount of complexity in the processing of messages, the conformity of arguments in general as well as conformity with the communicators own opinion. Every communicator wants to minimize uncertainty about its behavioral surroundings so these goals can more easily be attained. Every round, communicators decide with which levels they want to process incoming messages and produce new ones. They also decide if they want to search for new, more agreeable connections. The first decision is an integration of the communicators own preferences and what it thinks are the preferences of his community.<br>
	<br>
	How much it deviates from the perceived community norm in its own direction can be collapsed to a game, akin to a Prisoner's Dilemma: "Cooperating" by following a communicative norm is a sensible option if many people conform, because norm estimation would become less noisy. Deviation could however provoke like punishment behavior, leading to more noise indefinetily. In this way, the first decision is a Repeated Game with a reputation mechanism, which is potentially infinite in the minds of discussion participants.<br>
	<br>
	The second decision is a similar scenario: Communicators can search for contacts that are more similar to them in their preferences (based on their message output). Adding new contacts or severing old connections might be beneficial, but only the community remains the same (i.e., if the other community members do not also deviate).<br>
	<br>
	As the levels of elite polarization and nearness of the topic directly influence the perceived decision uncertainty, optimal strategies in one scenario might heavily differ from optimal strategies for the same communicator type in another.<br>
	<br>
	This model is agnostic with respect to opinion operationalization, as long as this operationalization allows for measures of uncertainty and similarity. Persuasiveness of messages is ascertained primarily by looking at behavior and only indirectly by looking at content. In this, the model heavily deviates from, e.g. Opinion Dynamics simulation models or even typical Game Theoretical models from Pragmatics.<br>
	<br>
	If optimal strategies for different situations are found, these might still not be optimal given the diffusion dynamics on large networks. Communicators cannot account for this, as the decision model is geared to shifts in opinion that are gradual and "bell-shaped". Low probability events like sudden opinion shifts in the neighborhood are not captured. In this way, optimal behavior according to the locally oriented decision model encodes the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludic_fallacy' target='_blank'>'Ludic Fallacy'</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias' target='_blank'>'Hindsight Bias'</a>. While it is unrealistic to assume people to behave rationally optimal in this way, if they did, they would still be forced to act on imperfect, local information while also having to "average out" low-probability events. As such, the decision model encodes the "best behavior" possible and it is interesting to see where this behavior does not lead to the intended results.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Agent-based model</b>: An agent-based model will be constructed to find situations on large networks where optimal behavior on the small scale would lead to suboptimal results on the large scale. A scenario of interest is of course a situation where a population with a large proportion of complexity- and diversity-loving agents becomes polarized in their opinions. The model parameters are network characteristics as well as social media dynamics such as the degree of likeness in content recommendatiions. <br>
	<br>
	Agents behave optimally as determined in the decision model. The proportions of agent types as well as the parameters governing elite polarization, topic nearness and social media mechanics are varied for experimental runs. However, experimental runs for a full-factorial design for these parameters and all possible network parameterizations would possibly consume months of computation time. Because of this, only network parameterizations akin to descriptions of the Twitter network will be used, with agent N constrained to 10.000. While this makes a full description of the system impossible, the simulation model can still serve as an explanatory model for the observed empirical data.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Empirical analysis:</b> The empirical analysis works with data obtained through the Twitter API. A sample of users connected in various communities is taken and the filtered stream of these users messages is collected over a period of two months.<br>
	<br>
	As research has shown, various non-content characteristics of a Tweet can influence its "retweetability", such as emotional content, numbers of followers and others. These could be seen as heuristic markers of message quality. Going further, the empirical analysis will relate the prevalence of <i>potential</i> heuristic markers in Tweets at some time t - 1 to polarization at time t. Users might not use these heuristic markers to ascertain persuasiveness, but the could only do so if they are there.If there is a systematic relation of heuristics usage to polarization, more heuristic markers should be present at some point in the past.<br>
	<br>
	The central point of the dissertation project is communication norms. So, the relationships of past heuristic marker prevalence to current polarization is assumed to vary over stable communities. The relationship might exhibit different lags or different effects.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Progress</b>: I am currently formally constructing the decision model. The project has undergone some iterations, going from a pure Opinion Dynamics simulation approach to decision modeling and empirical analysis. Because of this, the computational framework for the agent-based model is already implemented in R. I am also currently collecting data for empirical analysis through the Twitter API (see also <a href='/helpmeout'>Help Me Out</a>).

	<h3>Character Networks in Superhero Comics</h3>
	<br>
	<a href='{% static "jpg/ult_spider.jpeg" %}' target='_blank'><img src='{% static "jpg/ult_spider.jpeg" %}' class='float_right' /></a>
	<b>Outline</b>: Superhero comics are complex! Not many would put their signature under such a statement. However, fan communities and comics creators have long recognized that superhero comics behave like a seemingly closed system. Can it be described as a complex one? Interests of writers, artists, fans, editors and especially publishers and later media conglomerates diverge and lead to storylines through complex interactions, subject to economic feedback and reactions to the competition: Storylines as a complex output of many interacting parts, where you cannot pin down a single influence as a prime mover. That seems like a complex system. This side project is focused on character appearance networks as a proxy for "story" and how these networks are systematically influenced by different writers, artists, editors and publishers.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Methods</b>: Data on character appearances in superhero comics issues by the big publishers Marvel and DC were gathered from their respective wikia pages. The data considered captures character appearances from 1963 (where Marvels output begins in earnest) until 2015. Metadata on publishers, editors, writers and artists was also gathered for every issue. The data can display shifts in narrative, such as the incorporation of the reboot experiment "Ultimate Universe" into the main Marvel narrative. The big pink dot signifies the Spider-Man of the Ultimate Universe and how he is integrated over time until the his universe is destroyed in a big narrative event in 2015. These networks could be aggregated on different intervals and over different groups, enabling the construction of a typology. Clustering algorithms are used to achieve this and mixed models might uncover associations of metadata with network characteristics (see Progress below).<br>
	<br>
	<b>Results</b>: As a first analysis, I constructed co-occurence networks for each month and publisher. The characteristics of these networks display clear drifts over time and vary between the publishers. Using a mixture model, I identified five main classes that correspond to different "strategies" for character co-occurences. As is known by fans, DC prefers central characters like Superman to serve as bridges between series, while Marvel prefers more closely knit character communities. The overall prevalence of different network types does not vary considerably between publishers overall, however, considerable variation is evident over time. DC predominantly uses the aforementioned strategy until the 1980 and then mixes it with Marvels approach, while it is the other way around for Marvel.<br>
	<br>
	These network types can be linked to archetypes such as "small world" or "preferential attachment" networks. However, during the comics market hype of the late 1980s and 1990s, these clear structural markers disappear for both publishers and are not regained through the movie synergy phase of the 2000s. Research artefacts (e.g. small networks at the beginning of observation timeframe) could contribute to such a picture and these biases have to be eliminated in more thorough research.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Progress</b>: The described first analysis. The overall aim of this research is to relate predictors to network behavior. In the future, given enough free time, I would like to construct networks based on different series and creative teams and describe the differences. If these networks provide enough data in each of the groups, a generalized linear mixed model might uncover the variation in network characteristics due to artists, writers, editors, publishers, series as well as publication timeframe.<br>
